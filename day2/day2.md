## Creation Hymns of the Rig Veda

- Nasadiya Hymn
- Hiranyagarbha hymn



> NASADIYA is eternal singularity (as postulated by modern scientists) beyond existence and non-existence. No space-time, death or immortality. It is breathless impulsive vibration with potent. Then by power of heat (Tap) Desire came as Mind (Sankalp). Then comes the fabric (field) of creation. Followed by the causal seed of force, power and energy. Then Gods appear. Who knows, HE himself know or may not know. 

> HIRANYAGARBHA (Prajapati) rose as God of creation. He is adored and offered oblation for --- creating earth and heaven, vital breath (prana), power,energy, force and vigour. Death and life, physical body and Rasa. He prevails everything and everywhere. Created space and time. He created Jal, Agni and Neer. He regulates life cycle and productivity. In hymn 10.129 there is indication that The great scholars (Rishis) had revelation in wisdom (meditation) of the bond of existence (Sat) and non-existence (Asat) which is surprising. Also there is glimpse of modern hypothesis of creation from singularity and big bang theory. There is also open-endedness which may be equated with Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.
